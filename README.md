# Checkers-AI
the most complex project iv built so far, i wouldnv started building it if i had known for how complex it was going to b, basically i only decided to build it
cuz of the minimax aspect that was related to it, bfore creating this project i had completed the tic tac toe ai version i thought i had not done enough to understand exactly how
the algorithm worked so i thought itd b a good practice to go with another project that also dealt with the minimax algorithm but it was a lot more complex for me it took about 7 days
to complete  and even after as much time i spent i felt i was only being able to remember the syntax but i again gave it as much i could have done
i have created the project multiple times after the first time that took me a week to get over, in fact just the other day i went over it again built it from the scratch again while i
couldv done it in reasonable time if i just wanted to write the code but i searched almost for every line again as i was going through writing it which in turn took me a whole day to
write it.
i created this project after 1 month of learnin python and creating other projects on the way
